The two ways of having a variable BitRate are
inputting Average BitRate or ConstantRateFactor(CRF)

a software called MediaInfo to check the crf used
when encoding a video file.

codec is the thing that convert data from digital into Analogue

we are using a decoder, and when we are Recording a video through
our camera, we can say we are Encoding or we are using coder
when we try to convert a file structure from one codec to another
we are TransCoding, this time we are both decoding and encoding.
when we are trying to change aspectRatio or resolution or any other property
without changing the codec, we can say we are Re-Encoding,
